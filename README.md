## Features

### Scripts

This extension supports running CommandBox scripts as [VS Code tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks). Scripts containing the name 'build', 'compile', or 'watch' are treated as build tasks. Any scripts defined in the `box.json` will be auto-detected by default and added as VS Code tasks. You can also annotate VS Code task definitions in your `tasks.json` files using the `type` as `commandbox` and `script` as the script name.

To run scripts as VS Code tasks, use the Task menu items or commands.

#### Script Explorer

The CommandBox Script Explorer shows the CommandBox scripts found in your workspace. The explorer view is enabled by the setting `commandbox.enableScriptExplorer`. A script can be opened or run from the explorer.

#### Run Scripts from the Editor

The extension supports to run the selected script as a VS Code task when editing the `box.json` file. You can either run a script from the hover shown on a script or using the command `commandbox: Run Selected Script`.

#### Run Scripts from a Folder in the Explorer

The extension supports running a script as a VS Code task from a folder in the Explorer. The command `commandbox: Run Script in Folder...` shown in the Explorer context menu finds all scripts in `box.json` files that are contained in this folder. You can then select the script to be executed as a task from the resulting list. You enable this support with the `commandbox.runScriptFromFolder` which is `false` by default.

### Editing server.json

#### Schema

The extension ships with a schema for the `server.json` file to provide auto-completion and information on hover for standard properties. To ensure it is kept up-to-date without having to update the extension, the latest schema in the GitHub `master` is pulled when the extension is activated.
